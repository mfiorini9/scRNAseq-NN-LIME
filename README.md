# scRNAseq_NN_LIME

This repository outlines the code to train a neural network to classify individual cells according to treatment/disease status based on single-cell/nuclei RNA sequencing data and decode the trained models using LIME to reveal the most important genes characterizing treated/diseased cells. 

We have demonstrated the application of this framework in our manuscript titled "Interpretable machine learning classifiers implicate GPC6 in Parkinsonâ€™s disease from single nuclei midbrain transcriptomes". A pre-print is available on bioRxiv.
